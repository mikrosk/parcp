This is a log of changes that the ncurses C++ binding has gone
through starting with the integration of menu and forms integration
into the binding.

	+ Introduced the THROW and THROWS functions/macros to prepare
	  a smoother transition to real exception handling.
	+ Exception classes provided in etip.h
	+ Added the NCursesMenu class to support libmenu functionality.
	+ The inheritace relation between NCursesWindow and NCursesColorWindow
	  was kind of brain damage. Monochrome is a special case of colored, so
	  the relation should be just the opposite. This would allow all derived
	  classes like NCursesPanel, NCursesMenu or NCursesForm to have colors.
	  To resolve that design flaw I put the color functionality into the 
	  NCursesWindow class and it can be switched on by the static member
	  useColors(). NCursesColorWindow is still there for compatibility
	  reasons.
