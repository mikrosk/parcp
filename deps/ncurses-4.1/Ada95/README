Caveats:

   This is the first delivery of this binding. It has not been
   extensively tested. So I declare this as BETA level software,
   although it is delivered with an official release of ncurses.

   You should install the ncurses distribution around this binding
   first before you try to run the sample.

   This Binding is currently strictly for the GNAT compiler, because
   in one place I use a GNAT specfic runtime module (see doc.)
